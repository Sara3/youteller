<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### :warning: :warning: :warning: Disclaimer :warning: :warning: :warning:
This documentation and the project as a whole are a work in progress.

To say this project at this stage is based on and not just a slightly modified version of Firefly III would be an understatement.
Huge thanks to https://github.com/JC5 for making a fantastic application.
https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii

This docker-compose project is the foundation for creating a more sophisticated financial wellness system for myself.
I am only sharing this in the hopes that it can serve as a reference for others trying to do the same thing.

### Built With

Firefly III serves as the frontend for this stack

A simple python API server acts as the backend for processing anything I don't want to offload on Firefly

The python backend also implements a connection with Plaid for syncing financial information.
